SageMaker Experiments helps you manage iterations by automatically capturing the input parameters, configurations, and results, and storing them as ‘experiments’. You can work within the visual interface of SageMaker Studio, where you can browse active experiments, search for previous experiments by their characteristics, review previous experiments with their results, and compare experiment results visually."
What is Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth?,"Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth provides automated data labeling using machine learning. SageMaker Ground Truth will first select a random sample of data and send it to Amazon Mechanical Turk to be labeled. The results are then used to train a labeling model that attempts to label a new sample of raw data automatically. The labels are committed when the model can label the data with a confidence score that meets or exceeds a threshold you set. Where the confidence score falls below your threshold, the data is sent to human labelers. Some of the data labeled by humans is used to generate a new training dataset for the labeling model, and the model is automatically retrained to improve its accuracy. This process repeats with each sample of raw data to be labeled. The labeling model becomes more capable of automatically labeling raw data with each iteration, and less data is routed to humans."
How do I scale the size and performance of an Amazon SageMaker model once in production?,"Amazon SageMaker hosting automatically scales to the performance needed for your application using Application Auto Scaling.

Which instances can I use with Managed Spot Training?,Managed Spot Training can be used with all instances supported in Amazon SageMaker.
When should I use Managed Spot Training?,"Managed Spot Training is ideal when you have flexibility with your training runs and when you want to minimize the cost of your training jobs. With Managed Spot Training, you can reduce the cost of training your machine learning models by up to 90%."
Which AWS regions are supported with Managed Spot Training?,Managed Spot Training is supported on all AWS regions where Amazon SageMaker is currently available.
How does Manage Spot Training work?,"Managed Spot Training uses Amazon EC2 Spot instances for training, and these instances can be pre-empted when AWS needs capacity. As a result, Managed Spot Training jobs can run in small increments as and when capacity becomes available. The training jobs need not be restarted from scratch when there is an interruption as Amazon SageMaker can resume the training jobs using the latest model checkpoint. The built-in frameworks and the built-in computer vision algorithms with SageMaker enable periodic checkpoints, and you can enable checkpoints with custom models."
What is Managed Spot Training?,"Managed Spot Training with Amazon SageMaker lets you train your machine learning models using Amazon EC2 Spot instances, while reducing the cost of training your models by up to 90%."
What is Automatic Model Tuning?,Most machine learning algorithms expose a variety of parameters that control how the underlying algorithm operates. Those parameters are generally referred to as hyperparameters and their values affect the quality of the trained models. Automatic model tuning is the process of finding a set of hyperparameters for an algorithm that can yield an optimal model.
Do I need to write my own RL agent algorithms to train reinforcement learning models?,"No, Amazon SageMaker RL includes RL toolkits such as Coach and Ray RLLib that offer implementations of RL agent algorithms such as DQN, PPO, A3C, and many more."
Can I access the infrastructure that Amazon SageMaker runs on?,"No. Amazon SageMaker operates the compute infrastructure on your behalf, allowing it to perform health checks, apply security patches, and do other routine maintenance. You can also deploy the model artifacts from training with custom inference code in your own hosting environment."
Do I need to use a specific version of a framework that is supported on the target hardware?,No. Developers can run models using the Amazon SageMaker Neo container without dependencies on the framework.
Will you recommend specific hyperparameters for tuning?,"No. How certain hyperparameters impact the model performance depends on various factors and it is hard to definitively say one hyperparameter is more important than the others and thus needs to be tuned. For built-in algorithms within Amazon SageMaker, we do call out whether or not a hyperparameter is tunable."
Do I need to use Amazon SageMaker to train my model in order to use Amazon SageMaker Neo to convert the model?,No. You can train models elsewhere and use Neo to optimize them for Amazon SageMaker ML instances or AWS IoT Greengrass supported devices.
Can I optimize multiple objectives simultaneously like a model to be both fast and accurate?,"Not at this time. Right now, you need to specify a single objective metric to optimize or change your algorithm code to emit a new metric, which is a weighted average between two or more useful metrics, and have the tuning process optimize towards that objective metric."
Can I use Automatic Model Tuning outside of Amazon SageMaker?,Not at this time. The best model tuning performance and experience is within Amazon SageMaker.
How do you calculate the cost savings with Managed Spot Training jobs?,"Once a Managed Spot Training job is completed, you can see the savings in the AWS management console and also calculate the cost savings as the percentage difference between the duration for which the training job ran and the duration for which you were billed. Regardless of how many times your Managed Spot Training jobs are interrupted, you are charged only once for the duration for which the data was downloaded."
What is reinforcement learning?,Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
How long does a hyperparameter tuning job take?,"The length of time for a hyperparameter tuning job depends on multiple factors including the size of the data, the underlying algorithm, and the values of the hyperparameters. Additionally, customers can choose the number of simultaneous training jobs and total number of training jobs. All these choices affect how long a hyperparameter tuning job can last."
Are there limits to the size of the dataset I can use for training?,There are no fixed limits to the size of the dataset you can use for training models with Amazon SageMaker.
How much does Automatic Model Tuning cost?,"There is no charge for a hyperparameter tuning job itself. You will be charged by the training jobs that are launched by the hyperparameter tuning job, based on model training pricing."
How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?,"Though both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where the feedback provided to the agent is correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses a delayed feedback where reward signals are optimized to ensure a long-term goal through a sequence of actions."
How do I get started with Amazon SageMaker Neo?,"To get started with Amazon SageMaker Neo, you log into the Amazon SageMaker console, choose a trained model, follow the example to compile models, and deploy the resulting model onto your target hardware platform."
In which AWS regions is Amazon SageMaker Neo available?,"To see a list of support regions, view the AWS region table."
Do I need to periodically checkpoint with Managed Spot Training?,"We recommend periodic checkpoints as a general best practice for long running training jobs. This prevents your Managed Spot Training jobs from restarting if capacity is pre-empted. When you enable checkpoints, Amazon SageMaker resumes your Managed Spot Training jobs from the last checkpoint."
How is Amazon SageMaker Autopilot different from vertical AI services like Amazon Personalize and Amazon Forecast?,"While Amazon Personalize and Amazon Forecast specifically target at personalized recommendation and forecasting use cases, Amazon SageMaker Autopilot is a generic automatic machine learning solution for classification and regression problems, such as fraud detection, churn analysis, and targeted marketing. Personalize and Forecast focus on simplifying end to end experience by offering training and model hosting in a bundle. You can train models using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot and get full access to the models as well as the pipelines that generated the models. They can then deploy the models to the hosting environment of their choice, or further iterate to improve model quality."
When should I use reinforcement learning?,"While the goal of supervised learning techniques is to find the right answer based on the patterns in the training data and the goal of unsupervised learning techniques is to find similarities and differences between data points. In contrast, the goal of reinforcement learning techniques is to learn how to achieve a desired outcome even when it is not clear how to accomplish that outcome. As a result, RL is more suited to enabling intelligent applications where an agent can make autonomous decisions such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, HVAC, industrial control, and more."
Can I bring my own RL libraries and algorithm implementation and run in Amazon SageMaker RL?,"Yes, you can bring your own RL libraries and algorithm implementations in Docker Containers and run those in Amazon SageMaker RL."
