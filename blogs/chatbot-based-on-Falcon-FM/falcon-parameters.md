# FalconÏùò Parameters

- temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.

- max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20, max value is 512.

- repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. Default is null.

- seed: The seed to use for random generation. Default is null.

- stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.

- top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null, which disables top-k-filtering.

- top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling, default to null

- do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.

- best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs, default to null.

- details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.

- return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.

- truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.

- typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.

- watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
